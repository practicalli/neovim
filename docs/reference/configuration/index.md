# Practicalli Configuration Designs

Practicalli Astro 5 is the current configuration used for the Practicalli Neovim book.

[Customising Astro 5](../../install/customise-configuration.md) describes the design of that configuration.


[Astrocommunity](astrocommunity.md) - override plugin defaults


## Retired Configurations

Designs of previous Neovim configurations are kept for posterity, although none of these configurations are actively maintained.

- [Astro (Astro 4)](astro4.md)
- [neovim-config-redux](fenel-config/index.md) (fenel)



> NOTE: Practicalli may return to a fennel based configuration in future, although a Lua based configuration is very easy to work with.
