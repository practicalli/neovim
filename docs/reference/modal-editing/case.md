# Modifying text case

Convert Characters and regioins to upper or lower case text.


## Toggle case with visual select

`v` to visually select a character or use the vim motion keys to select a region

`U` to uppercase current character or selected region

`u` to lowercase current character or selected region

`~` to toggle the case of the text in the selected region

> `.` will repeat the previous selection size and case toggle


## Toggle case menu

Toggle the current character using vim motion keys, without needing to select a region.

`g ~` opens the toggle case menu

> TODO: Add screenshot of `g ~` toggle case menu

> `g ~ ~` uppercase current line (also works for `RET` and maybe other none-menu characters, but not `SPC`)
