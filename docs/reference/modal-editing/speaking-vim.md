# Learning to speak Vim

Neovim is easier to learn and gain much more benefit from if you learn to speak commands as sentences.

First learn some verbs:

- `c` change
- `d` delete
- `g` go,
- `v` visual select
- `y` yank (copy)

Then use those verbs with some modifiers

- `'` mark
- `{ }` beginning/end of paragraph
- `0` start of line
- `^` first non white-space character of line
- `$` end of line
- `a` around
- `f` find (includes character)
- `i` inside a range (e.g. word, paren,)
- `s` surround
- `t` till (move just before specified character)

Then learn the text objects you can apply verbs and modifiers too

- `b` block/parentheses
- `p` paragraph,
- `s` sentence
- `t` tag e.g. html/xml
- `w` word
