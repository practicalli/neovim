# Narrowing

Narrowing to a region enables vim commands to be applied to a specific part of the current buffer, rather than the whole buffer.

Common examples include
- replacing local variables within a specific function (avoiding affecting other function definitions)

## NrrwRgn plugin

[:fontawesome-brands-github: NrrwRgn plugin](https://github.com/chrisbra/NrrwRgn) is inspired by the [:globe_with_meridians: Narrowing feature of Emacs](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Narrowing)
and means to focus on a selected region while making the rest inaccessible.

<!--
`SPC n r` opens a select region in a new split window.  The original buffer is protected from changes.

`:w` to write changes in the narrowed window to the original buffer


## Commands

`:NR`  - Open the selected region in a new narrowed window
`:NW`  - Open the current visual window in a new narrowed window
`:WR`  - (In the narrowed window) write the changes back to the original buffer.
`:NRV` - Open the narrowed window for the region that was last visually selected.
`:NUD` - (In a unified diff) open the selected diff in 2 Narrowed windows
`:NRP` - Mark a region for a Multi narrowed window
`:NRM` - Create a new Multi narrowed window (after :NRP) - experimental!
`:NRS` - Enable Syncing the buffer content back (default on)
`:NRN` - Disable Syncing the buffer content back
`:NRL` - Reselect the last selected region and open it again in a narrowed window

Appending `!` to most commands opens the narrowed part in the current window instead of a new window.

> `:WR!` closes the narrowed window in addition to writing to the original buffer.
