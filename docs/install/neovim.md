### Provider warnings & disable options

NeoVim and its packages may delegate features to language and tool specific [providers](https://neovim.io/doc/user/provider.html){target=_blank}.

Resolve the issue with providers that generate a warning in the checkhealth report, following the ADVICE steps.

Or disable a specific provider if not required to remove the warning from the report. Details on how to disable a provider are included at the end of the ADVICE in the report section for that provider.

![NeoVim checkhealth report - python provider warning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/neovim/screenshots/neovim-checkhealth-warning-python.png)

So to disable the python provider, add `let g:loaded_python3_provider = 0` to the Neovim configuration.

> Each NeoVim package used should be checked to see if it requires a specific provider.
