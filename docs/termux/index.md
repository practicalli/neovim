# NeoVim on Termux

A smart phone or tablet and an external keyboard can make an excellent ultra-portable development environment, especially when travelling with limited space or restricted weight constraints.

Termux can be [installed using the F-Droid marketplace](fdroid-install.md){target=_blank}, as with installing any other Android app.

!!! WARNING "Do not install Termux App from the Google Play store"
    The Termux App in Google Play store is significantly out of date and will not work properly and probably not at all

## Keyboard

[Atreus from Keyboardio](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/keyboardio-atreus) is an excellent travel keyboard and was used to write most of the Practicalli Neovim configuration and Neovim book (especially during delays at airports)


[Model 100 from Keyboardio](https://shop.keyboard.io/products/model-100) is used by Practicalli at the office 


## Running Termux

Run Termux from the app launcher added as an android app by the F-Droid install.

> Termux may not display in fullscreen when Android productivity mode, usually activated on tablets when physical keyboard or mouse is attached.  Disabling productivity mode in the Android settings is recommended.
