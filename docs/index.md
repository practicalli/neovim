!!! QUOTE "coding at the speed of thought"
    Neovim is incredibly fast and efficient, so thoughts flow from brain to editor without unnecessary delay.

    Touch typing is fast, Neovim and multi-modal editing makes it even faster.

Neovim is a highly extensible and powerful editor, supporting multi-modal editing and Vim-style sequential key bindings. Highly responsive and low resource use makes Neovim ideal for development on any computer or [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: mobile device](termux/), e.g. tablet, smartphone.

Neovim has [:globe_with_meridians: a diverse set of plugins](https://neovimcraft.com/){target=_blank} and [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli curated configurations](/neovim/configuration/) use these plugins to provide a [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: rich set of features](introduction/features.md) for Clojure development and wider engineering tasks.


Practicalli Neovim provides install & user guide focused on a simple, powerful and satisfying [REPL Driven workflow](introduction/repl-workflow.md) for Clojure.

## Quick Start

Install [Clojure](install/clojure.md), [Neovim](install/neovim.md) and choose a community configuration

- [Lua] [AstroNvim](configuration/astronvim/)
- [Fennel] [Practicalli Neovim Config Redux](configuration/practicalli/)

## Navigate the book

Use the mouse or built-in key bindings to navigate the pages of the book

- ++p++ , ++comma++ : go to previous page
- ++n++ , ++period++ : go to next page

Use the search box to quickly find a specific topic

- ++f++ , ++s++ , ++slash++ : open search dialog
- ++arrow-down++ , ++arrow-up++ : select next / previous result
- ++esc++ , ++tab++ : close search dialog
- ++enter++ : follow selected result


## Sponsor my work

[![Sponsor practicalli-john](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/buttons/practicalli-github-sponsors-button.png){ align=left loading=lazy }](https://github.com/sponsors/practicalli-johnny/)

All sponsorship recieved is used to maintain and further develop the [Practicalli series of books and videos](https://practical.li/){target=_blank}, although most of the work is still done with my own time and cost.

Thank you to [Cognitect](https://www.cognitect.com/){target=_blank}, [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/){target=_blank} and a wide range of other [sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/practicalli-john#sponsors){target=_blank} from the Clojure community for your continued support
