## Quick Start

Install [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Clojure](install/clojure.md), [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Neovim 0.10.0](install/neovim.md) and [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Astro configuration](configuration/astronvim/)


## Neovim overview

Neovim is a highly extensible and powerful editor, supporting multi-modal editing and Vim-style sequential key bindings. Highly responsive and low resource use makes Neovim ideal for development on any computer or [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: mobile device](termux/), e.g. tablet, smartphone.

Neovim has [:globe_with_meridians: a diverse set of plugins](https://neovimcraft.com/){target=_blank} to provide a [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: rich set of features](introduction/features.md) for Clojure development and wider engineering tasks.

!!! QUOTE "coding at the speed of thought"
    Neovim is incredibly fast and efficient, so thoughts flow from brain to editor without unnecessary delay.

    Touch typing is fast, Neovim and multi-modal editing makes it even faster.
