# REPL Driven Development with Clojure

Conjure provides the REPL driven development workflow for Clojure (and many other fun languages) and includes a built-in tutorial.

- [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Starting a REPL & Evaluating code](conjure/) - using Conjure
- [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Structural Editing](structural-editing/) - parinfer or paredit
- [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Refactor tools](refactor-tools/) - Language Server Protocol features
- [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Unit Testing](testing/) - run REPL or external test runners
- Inspecting data, e.g. [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Portal](https://practical.li/clojure/data-inspector/portal/){target=_blank}


!!! INFO "Pre-requisite: multi-modal editing"
    [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Multi-modal Editing](/neovim/neovim-basics/multi-modal-editing/) is a recommended pre-requisite

!!! INFO "Aliases to run Clojure REPL - Practicalli Clojure CLI Config"
    [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Practicalli Clojure CLI config](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/practicalli-config/){target=_blank} contains aliases used to start a Clojure REPL and other development tools.  Aliases are used extensively through the Clojure sections of this book.

??? WARNING "Practicalli Neovim config replaces some key bindings"
    [Practicalli Neovim Config](/neovim/configuration/practicalli/){target=_blank} replaces several key bindings to make them consistent with other Clojure editors
